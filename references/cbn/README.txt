This is the source code of the Stutter language interpreter and examples
presented in Gary W. Flake's book "The Computational Beauty of Nature",
ISBN 978-0262561273.

Stutter is minimalist Lisp "that only understands car, cdr, cons, if, 
set, equal, quote, and lambda, but is still Turing-complete" (from the 
source code, stutter.c).

The *.slp files are examples written in Stutter.

The files were extracted from an archive containing other examples from
the book, copied on 2011-10-29 from:
